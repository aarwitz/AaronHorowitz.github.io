                My name is Aaron Horowitz and this is my portfolio.
                <br><br>
                I am from Boca Raton, Florida and currently live in Boston, Massachusetts. I work as a Software Engineer at Cognex on the In-Sight product team.
                <br><br>
                I have a B.S. in Finance and an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.
                I was a research assistant at the BU Robotics Lab, where I learned the basics of labeling large datasets and computer vision.
                I also like writing essays on topics I am curious about, usually related in some way to philosophy of mind.
                <br><br>
                I made this website because I wanted to record my progress in building things and writing my ideas down.
