                <p class="mb-4">
                    There is a growing sense, particularly in the West, that today’s children may not attain living standards any higher than those of their parents, on average. <em>Where Is My Flying Car?</em> provides a much-needed technological framing for this new zeitgeist.
                    Hall includes many of the charts popularized by “WTF Happened in 1971?” for this book’s premise of post-1970’s secular stagnation, but he does not dwell on economic indicators. The main indicator of stagnation that this book points to is the existence of ready-to-build, yet unbuilt, technology.

                <p class="mb-4">In Hall’s perspective, the greatest barriers to progress are cultural, not technological. For context, this makes a break with Tyler Cowen’s book, The Great Stagnation, which attributes lower economic growth to all of the low hanging fruits having been picked in previous generations.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">To read this book you must be prepared to imagine that a radically different future is possible, that there are always fruits to be picked if one studies science enough — because the book is filled with, frankly, inconceivable claims. Powered by atomic batteries, “your iPhone would never need charging, and your Tesla would have a range of 3.5 million miles” (160). With nanotech as described in Eric Drexler’s Nanosystems, we could have “a pocket iPrinter capable of conjuring up anything from snacks to items of clothing out of thin air” (271) and “cell-repair machines that make us considerably less vulnerable to the health effects of radiation; a happy by-product of such technology would be allowing us to live in space (210).” One molecular motor designed by Drexler “would produce about three billion horsepower-per-pound” (211). Orbital infrastructure such as sunshades could control the temperature of Earth with ease and “generate more power than the human race currently uses” (272), which could be used in space to “focus a few petawatts of sunlight on [an asteroid approaching Earth]… enough to prevent a strike” (274).</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Why aren’t we living in that kind of future? It is not because further progress is impossible, but rather that our culture’s values have shifted dramatically. For Hall, the Morlock-Eloi dichotomy updated in H.G. Wells’ The Shape of Things To Come best describes the phase change humanity is currently undergoing. “The villains of Things to Come are well-to-do people who feel that they have enough for a comfortable life, and don’t want any accomplishments going on in their backyard” (14). The phrase NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) has become very popular because of this trend.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Hall and Wells believe that at the root of our cultural problem lies humanity’s failure to adapt to a changing evolutionary landscape. In contrast to all of human history, exploration of the unknown is not necessary to survive. We’ve moved up Maslow’s hierarchy, and life is so comfortable that we have raised our bar for risk-reward tradeoffs. As a species that has traded security for possibility, still craving esteem but disregarding accomplishment, “we have managed to create a society in which a growing majority of people are doing useless, and in many cases counterproductive, work, but in which we all believe that we’re making the world better” (97). Hall posits a sort of collective delusion in which, “in the age of Aquarius, our focus largely shifted from conquering the physical world, to conquering the interior worlds of other people” (97).</p>
                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">I. Defining “The Future We Were Promised”</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Hall first recalls “the future we were promised” by listing 28 technologies that Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein, “the major technologically savvy science fiction writers of the 1960s,” predicted for the present day (18). To name a few:</p>
                <ul class="mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Orbital space stations/li>
                    <li>Nuclear rockets</li>
                    <li>Pocket telephones and videophones</li>
                    <li>Nuclear fission & fusion power</li>
                    <li>Wireless energy transmission</li>
                    <li>Transportation at 1,000 miles per hour and one cent per mile</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4">A majority of the technologies in this long list have not been realized. Sci-fi writers of the past may appear optimistic, especially to younger generations, but Hall is old enough to remember their reasoning.</p>
