                <p class="mb-4">
                    There is a growing fear, particularly in the West, that today’s children may not on average attain living standards any higher than those of their parents. <em>Where Is My Flying Car?</em> provides a much-needed technological framing for this new zeitgeist.
                    Hall includes many of the charts popularized by “WTF Happened in 1971?” for this book’s premise of post-1970’s secular stagnation, but he does not dwell on economic indicators. The main indicator of stagnation that this book points to is the existence of ready-to-build, yet unbuilt, technology.
                </p>
                <img src="flyingcar.jpg" alt="Flying Car" class="my-4 rounded shadow-lg">
                <p class="mb-4">In Hall’s perspective, the greatest barriers to progress are cultural, not technological. For context, this makes a break with Tyler Cowen’s book, The Great Stagnation, which attributes lower economic growth to all of the low hanging fruits having been picked in previous generations.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">To read this book you must be prepared to imagine that a radically different future is possible, that there are always fruits to be picked if one studies science enough — because the book is filled with, frankly, inconceivable claims. Powered by atomic batteries, “your iPhone would never need charging, and your Tesla would have a range of 3.5 million miles” (160). With nanotech as described in Eric Drexler’s Nanosystems, we could have “a pocket iPrinter capable of conjuring up anything from snacks to items of clothing out of thin air” (271) and “cell-repair machines that make us considerably less vulnerable to the health effects of radiation; a happy by-product of such technology would be allowing us to live in space (210).” One molecular motor designed by Drexler “would produce about three billion horsepower-per-pound” (211). Orbital infrastructure such as sunshades could control the temperature of Earth with ease and “generate more power than the human race currently uses” (272), which could be used in space to “focus a few petawatts of sunlight on [an asteroid approaching Earth]… enough to prevent a strike” (274).</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Why aren’t we living in that kind of future? It is not because further progress is impossible, but rather that our culture’s values have shifted dramatically. For Hall, the Morlock-Eloi dichotomy updated in H.G. Wells’ The Shape of Things To Come best describes the phase change humanity is currently undergoing. “The villains of Things to Come are well-to-do people who feel that they have enough for a comfortable life, and don’t want any accomplishments going on in their backyard” (14). The phrase NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) has become very popular because of this trend.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Hall and Wells believe that at the root of our cultural problem lies humanity’s failure to adapt to a changing evolutionary landscape. In contrast to all of human history, exploration of the unknown is not necessary to survive. We’ve moved up Maslow’s hierarchy, and life is so comfortable that we have raised our bar for risk-reward tradeoffs. As a species that has traded security for possibility, still craving esteem but disregarding accomplishment, “we have managed to create a society in which a growing majority of people are doing useless, and in many cases counterproductive, work, but in which we all believe that we’re making the world better” (97). Hall posits a sort of collective delusion in which, “in the age of Aquarius, our focus largely shifted from conquering the physical world, to conquering the interior worlds of other people” (97).</p>
                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">I. Defining “The Future We Were Promised”</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Hall first recalls “the future we were promised” by listing 28 technologies that Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein, “the major technologically savvy science fiction writers of the 1960s,” predicted for the present day (18). To name a few:</p>
                <ul class="mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Orbital space stations/li>
                    <li>Nuclear rockets</li>
                    <li>Pocket telephones and videophones</li>
                    <li>Nuclear fission & fusion power</li>
                    <li>Wireless energy transmission</li>
                    <li>Transportation at 1,000 miles per hour and one cent per mile</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4">A majority of the technologies in this long list have not been realized. Sci-fi writers of the past may appear optimistic, especially to younger generations, but Hall is old enough to remember their reasoning.</p>

                    To many people of 1962, including my eight-year-old self, it was inconceivable that we would be using the same flying machines now that we did then. “What will our transportation technology look like in 50 years?” You might have asked them. And they would have answered, “Well, look what it was like 50 years ago, in 1912!” (24).

                </blockquote>
                <p class="mb-4">Flying cars currently on the market use roughly the same power systems and control surfaces as helicopters and/or planes of the past. They have been ready for mass-manufacture since the 1950’s but “the agencies turned thumbs down… because everybody would have one, and we couldn’t handle the [air] traffic” (110). Most people don’t like them because they are loud or appear dangerous. Hall disputes this, for example by citing that the leading cause of death in private plane owners is by motorcycle accident, but he also recommends that we use more advanced tech.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Hall discusses many possibilities for flying cars which may improve performance. One is composed of a shape-changing structure, made possible with molecular manufacturing, such that the wing can adapt to various flight regimes.1 Another type of flying car is the ionocraft which propels itself by maintaining a voltage and ionizing the surrounding air, without requiring moving parts. One example of a working prototype, though not capable of carrying much weight, is Subrata Roy’s patented WEAV.2TODO</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Exponential improvement in technologies has been limited to electronics, but Hall believes that all of technologies he lists can exhibit similar trends. The longer we put off experimenting and building, the further back in this trend we are. Making a case for molecular manufacturing all the way back in 1959, Richard Feynman said in his lecture, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom”, “In the year 2000, when they look back at this age, they will wonder why it was not until the year 1960 that anybody began seriously to move in this direction” (1).3TODO</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If we could “arrange the atoms one by one”, as Feynman said, engineering practices and living standards would look dramatically different. Some of Hall’s more ambitious claims for nanotechnology include, “[With nanotech] you could physically rebuild America in a week” (62), and “a fairly conservative nanofactory design reproduces itself in an hour” (57).</p>
                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">II. Posing the question: What happened to the future we were promised?</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">So, why not? Why do some technologies make the jump from theoretically possible to successfully realized, while others do not? Why did we miniaturize computation but not manufacturing, both of which Feynman clearly foresaw?</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Hall is far from the only one bewildered by our shortcomings. A debate between Peter Thiel and David Graeber resulted in agreement on at least one key issue: technological innovation has fallen dramatically short outside of electronics. “We all kind of knew what was going to happen,” Graeber says, before rattling off a few Space Age predictions for the 21st century, “and I don’t think any of us expected we would get all of that stuff within our own lives, but I don’t think it occurred to any of us that we wouldn’t get any of it.”</p>
                <p class="mb-4">In contrast, Graeber notes, those growing up at the turn of the century reading HG Wells and Jules Verne did get a lot of the tech they were expecting. “Flying machines, submarines, talking boxes,” whereas today, “even the things we have poured resources into, we never got anything close to what we thought we’d have.” Neither Thiel nor Graeber quite provided an explanation for this discontinuity. Hall continues the dialogue in his book, noting Thiel’s catchphrase, “We wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters” (27).</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">III. Answering the question: Every problem is an energy problem</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Graeber is not entirely correct, though. Hall points out that, “as a whole, the science fiction writers were roughly on target, in most fields except transportation and space exploration… Pocket phones, and the global library, are here with a vengeance. They call for robots in the 2020s, for bioengineering in the 2030s… but in transportation they thought we might have interstellar probes, asteroid mining, and gravity control by 2050” (20).</p>
                <p class="mb-4">So, we did get some of the technology we expected. It turns out that between the classes of technologies we got and those we didn’t, there is a glaring difference: <b>energy intensity.</b></p>
                <img src="TechEnergyPlot.jpg" alt="Flying Car" class="my-4 rounded shadow-lg">
                <p class="mb-4">Put simply, moving digital media (Twitter) does not require as much energy as moving people (flying cars). And, because energy consumption per-capita peaked around 1970 (33), we have achieved the former but not the latter. The Henry Adams curve, in the figure below, is the equivalent of Moore’s Law for energy, except we did not follow it. Hall invites the reader to imagine what a world with exponential progress in energy would look like.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">IV. The Two Causes of Stagnation: Eloi and Incompetent Bureaucrats</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">If energy abundance can make flying cars economical (and all of the other futuristic tech) why hasn’t more attention been drawn to potential novel energy sources? Hall writes that H.G. Wells’ Eloi and centralized funding through bureaucracies have prevented progress in energy. Many incompetent bureaucrats are also Eloi, and visa-versa, but the two cases will be treated separately.</p>
                <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-6">Cause 1: Eloi</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">In Wells’ Time Machine, class division begot speciation. One of the two species, the Eloi, as mentioned above, can be described with the popular term NIMBY’s. Central to this terminology is a new paradigm of social conflict which pits not rich against poor, haves against have-nots, or one ethnicity against another, but instead <b>Doers against Do-Nots</b>. “The Do-Nots favor stagnation and are happy turning our civilization into a collective couch potato,” Hall writes. “They will tell us that the promised future is not simply late, but that it was never realistic to begin with” (28).</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Hall writes at length about those who are fundamentally opposed to progress and will always find reasons to resist technology. To prove his point, Hall includes quotes from luminaries such as Paul Ehrlich, the progenitor of Malthusian catastrophism (168):</p>

                    Giving society cheap, abundant energy would be the equivalent of giving an idiot child a machine gun.
